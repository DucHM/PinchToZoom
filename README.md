# PinchToZoom
Android's ImageView pinch-to-zoom made easy

## Overview
PinchToZoom for Android is a simple but feature complete library project for adding pinch-to-zoom functionality to an *ImageView*. It has sleek easing animations that make it stand out in quality and ease of use.

### Features
* Pinch-to-zoom
* Double-tap to quickly zoom-in and out
* Drag while zoomed in
* Animated drag & zoom release easing
* Does not extend the *ImageView* class so is usable with custom *ImageView* implementations
* Fully customizable

## Customization
The *ImageMatrixTouchHandler* class has multiple getter/setter methods that allow for changing the behavior and animation settings. Consult the project's Javadoc for further explanation.
